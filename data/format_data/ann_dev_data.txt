PURPOSE: To determine whether the volatile anesthetic <e1>halothane</e1> protects against light-induced <e2>photoreceptor</e2> degeneration in the rodent retina.

RESULTS: <e1>Halothane</e1> anesthesia reversibly inhibited metabolic <e2>rhodopsin</e2> regeneration and thus prevented rhodopsin from absorbing high numbers of photons during light exposure.

Our results show that <e1>acetylcholinesterase</e1> inhibitors induce significant cardiovascular effects with a pressor response mediated mainly by the stimulation of central muscarinic M2 receptors inducing a secondary increase in sympathetic outflow and <e2>vasopressin</e2> release.

<e1>Cocaine</e1> block of <e2>hH1 channels</e2> was greater than block of mu1 channels at voltages between -120 mV and -90 mV, suggesting that greater steady-state inactivation of hH1 channels in this voltage range makes them more susceptible to cocaine block.
